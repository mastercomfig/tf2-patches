# Welcome to Team Comtress 2!

### What *is* TC2?

Team Comtress 2 is a set of modifications on top of an older version of Team Fortress 2, with a community development team fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding quality of life features, with the goal of having those changes pulled upstream by Valve to the modern game.

TC2 is mostly about the changes made _on top_ of a mid-Jungle Inferno development build of the game, so please keep in mind that it isn't a fully polished experience.

## How can I help?

1. **Report bugs that exist in live TF2 *or* TC2 through the [issues page](https://github.com/mastercomfig/tf2-patches/issues).**
	* Bugs that are present in modern TF2 but are not present in TC2 cannot be fixed in this project.
2. **Suggest quality of life improvements (*not balance changes*) through the [issues page](https://github.com/mastercomfig/tf2-patches/issues).**
	* These changes should not affect gameplay, and should be unanimously desired.
3. **Install TC2 and play the game to test stability, bugfixes, and performance.**
	* As a separate game, you cannot play normal TF2 matchmaking. You can *only* connect to TC2 servers.
	* Information about multiplayer playtests can be found [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/CuPb2zV).

## Basic Installation

New users should follow this approach.

1. Copy your current `Team Fortress 2` installation to a new folder.
2. In your copied TF2 folder, delete the `tf/custom` and `tf/addons` folders if you have them, as well as `tf/cfg/autoexec.cfg`, `tf/cfg/config.cfg`, and any class configs (such as `heavyweapons.cfg` or `spy.cfg`). One of the points of the changes we are making is to remove the need for graphical or networking configs. Do not have mastercomfig installed.
	* Do *not* delete the entire `tf/cfg` folder!
3. [Download](https://github.com/mastercomfig/tf2-patches/releases/latest) `game_dist.zip` from the latest release.
4. ![Unblock ZIP](https://kb.corel.com/Attachments/kcs-180590/unblock3.png) <br> Right click on the ZIP, open Properties, and then Unblock it to speed up extraction and prevent conflicts with anti-virus software triggering false positives.
5. Extract the downloaded ZIP to your copied TF2 folder, overwriting existing files.
6. On your Steam Library, right click TF2, click properties then open the "Updates" tab and untick the option "Enable Steam Cloud Synchronization for TF2".
7. Double click `start_tf2.bat`. Note that you must have Steam running.
8. Enjoy!
